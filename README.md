## Getting Started

**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**
**Modify this file to match your project, remove sections that don't apply. For example: delete the testing section if the currect project doesn't require testing.**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
### Setup
- clone the Repo: https://github.com/RokoVarano/Leaderboard.git
### Install
- In the cloned project folder, run 'npx webpack serve'
### Usage
- To add a new score, just type a name and a score in the corresponding fields and hit 'Submit'
- Hit 'Refresh' to load the current score list. 
- the game ID is saved in localStorage, so that the same game can be referenced multiple times
### Run tests
- No tests yet
## I learned:
- That API calls don't return objects, making it more comfortable to work withing their scope first
- That localStorage can be very useful to send params between async functions
